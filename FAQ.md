# fmtcount package FAQ

This is the old FAQ for the [fmtcount](https://ctan.org/pkg/fmtcount) package, copied from

See also the [package documentation](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/fmtcount/fmtcount.pdf)

Most of the information in this FAQ only refers to queries and issues with old versions (before 2015).

## General Queries

<a name="fmtlang" />

### Is there multilingual support?

Currently there is multilingual support for:
- English (from UK and USA),
- French (from France, Belgium and Switzerland),
- Spanish,
- Portuguese (from Portugal and Brazil),
- German,
- Italian,
- Arabic.

<a name="fmtwhylimitedlang" />

### Why is there only limited multilingual support?

Because there is a limit to the number of languages I can speak!
If you like, you can volunteer to write and maintain a language file for `fmtcount`.

<a name="frenchdialects" />

### How do I get 'septante' instead of 'soixante-dix'?

If the currently selected language is French, you can select the variants from Switzerland or Belgium, using:

```latex
\fmtcountsetoptions{french=swiss}
```
or
```latex
\fmtcountsetoptions{french=belgian}
```

<a name="fmtfem" />

### How do I get the feminine form instead of the masculine?

Use the optional argument `f` to `\ordinal`, etc:
```latex
\ordinal{<counter>}[f]
```
There is also `n` for neutral.

[2013-12-09 09:33:27]


<a name="fmtcountcfg" />

### How can I set up a different set of default package options?

Create a file called `fmtcount.cfg`, and put the appropriate commands in it. Then save it to somewhere on the TeX path. However, if you share your document code with other people, make sure you also supply your custom `fmtcount.cfg` file if it's important that they replicate your date and time format. (Note that if you are also using the [datetime](https://ctan.org/pkg/datetime) package, `datetime.cfg` will override `fmtcount.cfg`.)

[2013-12-09 09:35:57]


<a name="fmtlevel" />

### How do I get the ordinal suffix to be level instead of a superscript?

Use:
```latex
\fmtcountsetoptions{fmtord=level}
```

[2013-12-09 09:37:42]


<a name="ftmrefcount" />

### How do I use the value of a label in `\numberstring`, `\ordinalstring`, etc?

Try using Heiko Oberdiek's [refcount](https://ctan.org/pkg/recount) package which provides commands that will set a counter to the number given by a label. You can then pass that counter to `\numberstring`, etc. For example:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{fmtcount}
  \usepackage{refcount}

\begin{document}
\newcounter{myctr}\setcounterpageref{myctr}{pg:last}
First page. This document has \numberstring{myctr} pages.

\newpage
Second page.\label{pg:last}
\end{document}
```

<a name="fmterrors" />

## Package Errors

<a name="fmtmemoir" />

### The `fmtcount` package conflicts with the [memoir](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir) class

You need to use at least version 1.04 of the [fmtcount](https://ctan.org/pkg/fmtcount) package and use `\FCordinal` to access `fmtcount`'s version of `\ordinal` and use `\ordinal` to use [memoir](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir)'s version of that command.

[2013-12-09 09:40:25]


<a name="fmtenglishundef" />

### Unknown language 'english' error

Make sure you are using at least version 1.07 of the [fmtcount](https://ctan.org/pkg/fmtcount) package.

[2013-12-09 09:41:10]


<a name="fmtordinalengdef" />

### Command `\@ordinalMenglish` already defined

This bug appeared in version 1.06. You need to upgrade to a later version.

[2013-12-09 09:42:18]


<a name="fmtunexpectedoutput" />

## Unexpected Output

<a name="padzeroes" />

### `\padzeroes` is a digit short with `\decimal`

This was fixed in version 1.05.

[2013-12-09 09:43:28]


<a name="fmtuppercase" />

### `\MakeUppercase` doesn't work with `\ordinalstring`, etc

This is caused by the way `\MakeUppercase` expands its argument. (see, e.g. `\count` reference breaks `\MakeUppercase` or Case-changing oddities). As from version 1.09, you can use one of the commands `\ORDINALstring`, `\NUMBERstring`, etc, which will convert the text to upper case.

[2013-12-09 09:45:31]


<a name="fmtnospaces" />

### Spaces are ignored after `\numberstring`, `\ordinalstring`, etc

This was fixed in version 1.2.

[2013-12-09 09:46:13]


<a name="fmtl2h" />

## LaTeX2HTML Support

<a name="fmtl2hnocfg" />

### Why does LaTeX2HTML ignore `fmtcount.cfg`?

Because I haven't found a way to implement it.
